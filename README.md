# Language_Independent_SV
This repository contains all the programs I created in order to make a Speaker Verification (SV) system for my STEM1 project. This specific SV system uses Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) and will account for language dependency.
 
 # Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As people store more of their personal data online, there is a growing need for a better method of authentication. Although many mobile devices are equipped with fingerprint or facial recognition systems, a majority of PCs around the world lack biometric capabilities. Voice Authentication (VA) is perfect for these scenarios as it is a behavioral biometric that analyzes oneâ€™s habits as opposed to saving measurements, and its only requirement for authentication is a working microphone. However, before VA can be implemented on current systems worldwide, the issue of language dependency must be fixed. Language dependency causes VA systems to perform with different accuracies when tested with different languages. The aim of this project was to find factors that minimized language dependency and create a working VA system in Python that formats and compares recordings to determine the optimal threshold value which would allow for the highest detection accuracy at validation. This system was tested with 5 world languages from the Common Voice Dataset. Preliminary testing found that adjusting hyperparameters related to audio processing, was largely ineffective so different statistical tests were used in the Log-Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) portion of the algorithm. The results show that when an F-Test was used, the system, on average, performed with a ROC AUC of 74% compared to 72% with the Chi-Square Test. Using these findings and some more tweaking, this GMM VA system can be implemented on IoT devices as a new method of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
